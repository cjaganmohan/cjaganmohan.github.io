## Teaching Philosophy
My role as an educator is successful when I empower students to become independent, critical thinkers through inclusive, research-informed teaching. I believe teaching and research are complementary â€” insights from my research enable me to present concepts from multiple perspectives, while student interactions deepen my understanding of fundamental principles. I am committed to creating supportive learning environments where collaboration, respect, and open communication thrive, ensuring every student has the opportunity to succeed through personalized support in collaborative learning environments.
