Hi There! I am ***Jagan***. I am postdoctoral associate at Virginia Tech. I am working with [Erin Lanus] and my research focuses on test and evaluation of AI-enabled software systems.

Earlier, I earned my PhD from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.uta.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Arlington](http://www.uta.edu/uta/). My advisor is [Prof. Jeff Lei](https://mentis.uta.edu/explore/profile/yu-lei). Prior to that, I earned my *M.S. in Computer Science* from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2015, and my B.Tech degree in Information Technology in 2008. Before joining the graduate school, I was working as an Analyst Programmer from 2009 to 2012. You can find my CV [here](https://cjaganmohan.github.io/files/Simple_CV_Jagan.pdf).
