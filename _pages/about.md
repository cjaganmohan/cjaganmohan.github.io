Hi There! I am Jagan. I am postdoctoral associate at [Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI)](https://cyberinitiative.org/research/ai-assurance.html), Virginia Tech. My research focuses on ***AI Assurance***. In Summer 2021, I earned my PhD from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.uta.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Arlington](http://www.uta.edu/uta/) and my advisor is [Dr. Jeff Lei](https://mentis.uta.edu/explore/profile/yu-lei). Prior to that, I earned my *M.S. in Computer Science* from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2015, and my B.Tech degree in Information Technology in 2008. Prior joining the graduate school, I was working as an Analyst Programmer from 2009 to 2012.

My research interests are in the intersection of ***Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence***, focusing on the reliability and trustworthiness of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software systems.  My Ph.D. dissertation tries to address the challenges in ***Testing AI-based software systems***. The broader goal of my Ph.D. work is to develop methodologies and frameworks for testing AI applications. My dissertation work focuses on 1). testing the software components used to create ML models, 2). developing testing methods, techniques, and tools to test pre-trained DNN models (used in autonomous vehicles), and 3).developing explainable AI tools to provide explanations for a model's prediction -- [Dissertation](https://rc.library.uta.edu/uta-ir/handle/10106/30029).
