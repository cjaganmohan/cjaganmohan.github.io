I am a research assistant professor in the [Sanghani Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics](https://sanghani.cs.vt.edu) at Virginia Tech. My research interests are **at the intersection of Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence**, focusing on the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-enabled software systems. 

I am motivated to ***address the engineering challenges in developing and deploying an AI‐enabled software system*** in the real world. My current focus is developing approaches to test and evaluate ML-enabled systems across its lifecycle. Through my research, I aim to enable practitioners to develop, deploy and maintain trustworthy AI/ML systems. My CV is available [here](https://cjaganmohan.github.io/files/CV_Jagan.pdf).

Earlier, I was a postdoctoral associate in the Intelligent Systems Division at [Virginia Tech National Security Institute](https://nationalsecurity.vt.edu/research/isd.html), where I worked closely with [Dr. Erin Lanus](https://data-assurance.vt.domains). I earned my M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Texas at Arlington](http://www.uta.edu/uta/) under the advisement of [Prof. Jeff Lei](https://mentis.uta.edu/explore/profile/yu-lei).


Thank you for visiting my academic corner on the web. I am always eager to connect; Whether you are curious about my research, have suggestions or ideas for collaboration, or simply wish to discuss common interests, feel free to reach out using the provided contact information.

Hi There! I am ***Jagan***. I am postdoctoral associate at Virginia Tech. I am working with Dr.Erin Lanus and my research focuses on AI Assurance.

Earlier, I earned my PhD from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.uta.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Arlington](http://www.uta.edu/uta/). My advisor is [Prof. Jeff Lei](https://mentis.uta.edu/explore/profile/yu-lei). Prior to that, I earned my *M.S. in Computer Science* from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2015, and my B.Tech degree in Information Technology in 2008. Before joining the graduate school, I was working as an Analyst Programmer from 2009 to 2012. You can find my CV [here](https://cjaganmohan.github.io/files/Simple_CV_Jagan.pdf).


## Research Interests
  * **Software Engineering for AI-enabled systems**
  * **Testing and Debugging of Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) models**
  * **AI Assurance:** Explainability, Fairness, Generalizability
