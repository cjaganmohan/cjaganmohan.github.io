Hi There! I am Jagan. I am a recent doctoral graduate from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.uta.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Arlington](http://www.uta.edu/uta/). I earned my PhD in August, 2021 and my advisor is [Dr. Jeff Lei](https://mentis.uta.edu/explore/profile/yu-lei). I earned my *M.S. in Computer Science* from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2015, and my B.Tech degree in Information Technology in 2008. Prior joining the graduate school, I was working as an Analyst Programmer from 2009 to 2012.

My research interests are in the intersection of ***Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence***, focusing on the reliability and trustworthiness of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software systems.  My Ph.D. dissertation tries to address the challenges in ***Testing AI-based software systems***.
